# Cyberbully-Classifier
**Project Title:** Cyberbullying Type Classification

**Description:**
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on identifying and classifying different types of cyberbullying within text comments, specifically on Instagram. The project aims to address a gap in existing studies by not only determining whether a statement is cyberbullying but also categorizing the specific type of cyberbullying it represents.

**Objectives:**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA:** The project begins with exploratory data analysis to uncover prevalent keywords and phrases associated with cyberbullying, leveraging known characteristics.

**Classification ML Algorithms:** Machine learning algorithms are implemented to classify and differentiate the various types of cyberbullying present in the dataset.

Model Evaluation:** The performance of the classification model is assessed using proper evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-Score, specificity, as well as a confusion matrix.
